    "One of the main reasons for distinguishing between *errors* and *residuals* is that the estimation process *changes* the distributional properties of the errors. This means that *errors* and *residuals* are not expected to behave idnetically. So while it is correct to assume\n",

    "it is *not* technically correct to assume the same for the *errors*. This is because the estimation procedure can *induce* correlation between the errors and the errors can have non-constant variance, depending upon a property known as *leverage*. We will discuss some of these concepts next week. For now, just note that the residuals can be used as an *approximation* for the errors, but we need to perform some additional checks to make sure that this approximation is reasonable.\n",
